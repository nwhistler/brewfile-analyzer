# Changelog

All notable changes to Brewfile Analyzer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-11

### Added
- Silent background updates: `scripts/auto_update.sh` applies updates without prompts; first-run shows a concise, one-time prompt to enable the LaunchAgent.
- Update banner in UI: on next load after an update, a small banner appears and fades away.
- Installer options (macOS):
  - Enable automatic update checks (LaunchAgent, every 6h)
  - Optionally run the combined server in the background at login (LaunchAgent, KeepAlive)
- API: `/api/tools/recent` now accepts a `days` query parameter (default 30) to scope "Recent" to a time window.

### Changed
- New DuckDB insert behavior sets `last_edited = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for newly added tools, so they appear in "Recent" immediately.
- LaunchAgent labels no longer include the author handle; renamed to `com.brewfile-analyzer.updatecheck` and `com.brewfile-analyzer.server`.
- WARP.md updated with Ruff/CI rules; WARP.md added to .gitignore.

### Removed
- Developer-only `repo_update.py` (use `scripts/self_update.py` for installed app updates).

### Added
- Future enhancements will be listed here

### Changed
- Future changes will be listed here

### Fixed
- (none)

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-08

### Fixed
- Brewfile parsing now supports single- and double-quoted entries, optional whitespace after keywords, and case-insensitive matching for brew/cask/mas/tap lines (e.g., handles lines like `cask'hovrly'`).
- Detection now includes lowercase `brewfile` (and lowercase split variants) in addition to `Brewfile`.
